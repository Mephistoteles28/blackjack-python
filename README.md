# blackjack-python

My second project on Python is a card game, which is a Black Jack game,

1. This game just needs one player, and the player will against the system,
2. The player will be gifted 100 chips, and the player needs to input how much to put into the bet.
3. The system will show the player cards and ask if the player wants to hit it or not. (hit means take one card into player decks)
4. The system will show the system/dealer cards and if the value of the player card is more than the dealer cards, the player wins and the player chip is increased according to the bet amount.
5. And if the player's card is less than the dealer cards, the player will lose and the player's chip will decrease according to the bet amount.
6. The game will end if the player exit the game and the player chip is 0.
